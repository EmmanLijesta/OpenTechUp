# TechMarkUp
[TechMarkUp](https://www.youtube.com/@techmarkup) is about programming in Rust, JavaScript and Typescript, for machine and deep learning, and artificial intelligence. Other languages for markup and styles, such as HTML and CSS, as well as PostgreSQL for database management are also discussed here.

As its author, my utmost goal is to develop a model for Natural (Text) Language Processing (NLP) using Rust as its dominant programming language. Why use Rust? It’s for security, memory safety, concurrency and speed. Overall, economical and in par with C in energy use and execution time efficiency. This is also a project to prepare myself before continuing my master’s degree in Information Technology. Also, creating an NLP model in Rust could be challenging and fun.

I've been into programming for over 30 years now. Started with QBasic back in the summer of 1990 before entering high school, and played with other codings like Pascal, Delphi, Visual Basic, Java, C/C++ and Python.
